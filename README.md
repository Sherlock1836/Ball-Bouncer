# Ball-Bouncer
Ball Bouncer was made for my advanced object oriented programming course. This was back when I used Eclipse (now using VSCode and loving it so much more). At the time of publishing, I had just rediscovered this little project after a year and thought it was neat. I find it really satisfying to watch all the balls bounce around the screen and to attempt to observe the patterns they make. As of now I haven't compiled it for a nice release package but you can just clone the repo to try it out. One thing I'll change when I get a chance is the frame background (option for black).
