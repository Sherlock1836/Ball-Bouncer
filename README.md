# Ball-Bouncer
This app was suppoosed to be like a screensaver. It bounces a number of randomly colored balls around the screen (up to user how many). There is also an option to make their sizes change, as well as their color (original assignment required these features but I made them options because I wasn't a fan of how it looked).

Ball Bouncer was made for my advanced object oriented programming course. This was back when I used Eclipse (now using VSCode and loving it so much more). At the time of publishing, I had just rediscovered this little project after a year and thought it was neat. I find it really satisfying to watch all the balls bounce around the screen and to attempt to observe the patterns they make. As of now I haven't compiled it for a nice release package but you can just clone the repo to try it out. One thing I'll change when I get a chance is the frame background (option for black).
